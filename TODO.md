TODO
- Add support for chaining in string expression parser: function1() | function2()
- Add support for string concatenation in string expression parser: "string 1" & function1() & "string 2"
- Low priority: Refactor ParseResult and ProcessResult (used by some older parsers in this project) to use the regular Result class
